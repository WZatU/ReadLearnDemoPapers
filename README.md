#ReadLearnDemoPapers

A minimal, repeatable way to **read papers with hands-on demos**.

Rule: every paper folder must contain:
1) a short structured summary,
2) a list of must-answer questions,
3) a runnable Python demo that produces outputs.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -V
pip install -r requirements.txt
python papers/mapreduce_2004/mapreduce_demo.py
